>
>this message contains important information about our course Programmieren mit Python. Please read carefully:
>
> - please fill out the very short pre-course survey in wuecampus there will be at least one beginner and one advanced group (you can decide for yourself, which one to join)
> - the course starts on Monday, March 16, at 9:00 am for everyone after that, the beginner and advanced groups will meet at different times via Zoom (see tentative schedule in wuecampus)

### Pre-course survey

- **English or German**: Do you prefer to have this course in English or German?
- **Prior experience**: Have you ever worked with Python before? yes/no
- **Other languages**: Have you programmed in any other programming languages? Which ones?
- **Reading code**: Do you understand what the following Python code does? And would you feel comfortable explaining it to the class? yes (understanding)/yes (understanding and explaining)/no

```python
l = [1, 4, 6, 9, 2, 4, 3]
m = l[0]
for i in l:
  if i > m:
    m = i
print(m)
```

- **Writing code**: Do you feel comfortable writing Python code to solve the following problem and explaining it to the class? yes (coding)/yes (coding and explaining)/no

Given two lists (l1 and l2) with an equal number of elements, create a third list, l3, that contains the smaller of the two numbers from l1 and l2 at that position:

```python
l1 = [1, 4, 6, 9, 2, 4, 3]
l2 = [3, 2, 1, 6, 3, 7, 2]
# task: write some code that produces
l3 = [1, 2, 1, 6, 2, 4, 2]
```

## Setup Instructions

This is a hands-on course, so you will practice programming in Python using your own computer. Therefore, you need to install some required software:

- [python](https://www.python.org/) (just use the latest version)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (with [python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) and [jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) extensions)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (advanced group)

Please follow the instructions to first install python and then VS Code. Then install the extensions from within VS Code. If you plan to attend the advanced group, install Git, as well.

To finalize and test the installation, create a folder for the python course and open this folder in VS Code. Create a new file called "test.ipynb" and create a new "Code" cell in the created notebook. Enter "1+1" and click the little play icon to run the code. You will be prompted to install required packages. After confirming and waiting a minute, the result "2" should show up under the cell (see screenshot). 🎉 Congratulations, you are all set 🎉

As this course is about learning the basics of python programming yourself, disable the built-in AI features of VS Code. Navigate to `File > Preferences > Settings > Features > Chat > Disable AI Features` and select that option.

## Exam Assignments

Solve all six assignments in the Rosalind course room by March 7, 2025. As this is an official examination, you must solve the assignments independently. You can use Google but don't copy-paste solutions from someone else (including Chat-GPT). You need to upload your code for each challenge. Be prepared to explain your solution to Markus. In order to pass the exam:

- sign up for the exam in WueStudy
- solve all six assignments before the deadline
- Markus checks the code you submitted
- if the code looks suspicious you have to explain your solutions to Markus
- some students will be selected at random to explain their solutions to Markus
- if you are unable to explain your solution, you need to hand in another solution
